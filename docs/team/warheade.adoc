== PROJECT: League Tracker

---

== 1. Overview

This Project Portfolio documents my contribution to the software engineering project *League Tracker*, a group project
collectively done by four Undergraduate students in National University of Singapore under the module CS2113T.

*League Tracker* is a Command Line Interface desktop application designed for pass:[<u>organizers of both professional and
recreational football leagues</u>] in the world. For long, league organizers face immense difficulties when it comes to data storage,
data categorization, data updates and data analysis due to the sheer size, inter-connectivity and complexity
of data generated. Useful information are unfortunately trapped in silos. League Tracker aims to tackle the problem by providing
a convenient and efficient solution as an automated, PC-based software application. With League Tracker, data storage is secured;
data categorization is pre-set; data updates become a one-line task of updating match information as the subsequent updates
are automatically done internally by precise algorithms; data analysis is integrated and visualized to be reflective of real-time situations.


My main contributions to the project include: +

* Implementing player features, export feature and data analysis feature.

* Refactoring of the original *AddressBook 3* application.

* Ensuring inter-layer coherence between `Player` and `Team` as well as `Player` and `Match`.

== 2. Summary of Contributions

This section summarises my contributions to the project.

* *Code contributed*: [https://nuscs2113-ay1819s2.github.io/dashboard-beta/#=undefined&search=warheade[Click to view code]]

* *Main features implemented*:

** Implemented *Player Feature*.
*** What it does: This feature allows the user to conveniently store and manipulate player profiles by typing commands.
Specifically, the user can add/view/delete/edit/search for/sort/edit player profiles and record player transfers.
*** Justification: This feature is the foundation of the application, it improves the user-friendliness of the product,
as multiple commands are simplified so that all of the actions mentioned above can be achieved in one line of command.
*** Highlights: This feature involves refactoring of the original application's commands as well as incorporating new commands.
This feature also manages to achieve interaction with the `Team` feature and the `Match` feature so that
updates of data are automatically done when needed and the other two features will not run into bugs.

** Implemented *Export Feature*
*** What it does: This feature allows the user to conveniently export all stored data in League Tracker, including player profiles,
team profiles, match information and finance records to respective excel files.
*** Justification: This feature ensures that data is not trapped in League Tracker. With export enabled, the user can
backup the data any time. Also, excel files provide a more direct and visual alternative to view and process data,
which now also becomes League Tracker's advantage after enabling data exportation.
*** Highlights: This feature involves the use of `Apache Poi`, which is a three-party Java library. Insights are required on both `Apache Poi` and
League Tracker's internal data storage formats to make sure export is done correctly without data corruption or data loss.

** Implemented *Data Analysis Feature*
*** What it does: This feature allows the user to conveniently analyse data stored with League Tracker's internal algorithms
and generate a report summarizing results of the summary in just one line of command.
*** Justification: This features takes League Tracker a step further using data stored for common data analysis that
all league organizers definitely need to do on themselves. The use of tested and robust built-in algorithms greatly enhances reliability of the report generated as calculation would be
free of human errors. Furthermore, the team opens the floor to users by prompting further suggestions on what analysis should be done.
Therefore this feature can be easily updated to better cater to user needs.
*** Highlights: This feature involves using all stored data

== 3. Contributions to the User Guide

|===
|_Given below are selected sections I contributed to the User Guide. They showcase my ability to write easy-to-follow
documentation targeting end-users. My full contribution to User Guide include: `4.1 Player`, `4.5 Export`, `4.6 Data Analysis`,
`4.7 General`, `7 Command Summary`. Please refer to our user guide for more information.

|===

=== *Edit Player Profile*
You can use this `editPlayer` command to pass:[<u>edit information of an existing player's profile</u>]
in the League Tracker. +

First, you need to do a `listPlayer` command to pass:[<u>obtain the index number of the target player</u>] in league tracker's record.
This step is *necessary*.

Then, you can use `editPlayer` command to do edition on the attribute information by pass:[<u>providing respective
updated information</u>]. Consequently the profile of the target player will be edited in accordance with the
information provided.

[TIP]
====
Our `editPlayer` command allows the user to make changes to one or more attributes in the player profile.
Simply follow the format and key in only the attribute information that you want to update.

Please note that you need to key in at least one attribute to make the `editPlayer` command meaningful.
Old values will be overwritten by new inputs (including tags).
====

{empty} +


*Format* ï¼š

* `listPlayer` +
* `editPlayer INDEX_NUMBER [n/NAME] [p/POSITIONPLAYED] [a/AGE] [sal/SALARY] [gs/GOALSSCORED] [ga/GOALSASSISTED]
 [ctry/NATIONALITY] [jn/JERSEYNUMBER] [app/APPEARANCE] [hs/HEALTHSTATUS] [t/TAGS]`

('[]' means that this entry is optional, If it is not typed in the input, the original information for this particular
attribute will be kept unchanged)

*Example*:

let's say you want to edit the player profile of a player with name "Lionel Messi"

Specifically, you want to change the salary information to be '2000' in the league tracker.

* `listPlayer` +

[.text-center]

From the `listPlayer` command (See figure 1), you find out that the index number of player 'Lionel Messi' is 1.

* `editPlayer 1 sal/2000`

If the edition is executed successfully, a *success message* will be displayed to the user containing the player
profile after edition(See figure 2).

NOTE: You will not be allowed to change player's `team` using the `editPlayer` command. +
      It should be done using the `transfer` Command. +
      {empty} +
      Edition of `GOALSSCORED` is also blocked in `editPlayer` command to avoid interference with League Tracker's
      automatic update using match information


WARNING: As League Tracker's internal algorithms use players' `NAME` attributes to distinguish, identify and track
player objects, please be reminded that edition of `NAME` using `editPlayer` command pass:[<u>should be
treated carefully after thorough considerations</u>]. You most likely need to adjust respective match information to make sure your action will not cause unwanted consequences.

=== Export Feature
==== Current Implementation
The export feature consists of four commands: `exportPlayer`, `exportTeam`, `exportMatch` and `exportFinance`. Taking
`exportPlayer` as the example, it is facilitated by `PlayerApachePoiWriter`, which is a class using methods provided
by the external Java library `Apache Poi`. Internally, an object of  `PlayerApachePoiWriter` is instantiated to write
all `Player` to the default file path `exported_player_record.xls`. Currently, each of the four writer classes implements a `write()` function.

* *PlayerApachePoiWriter#write()* --- Writes the index number, name, team name, position played, age, salary,
goals scored, goals assisted, nationality, jersey number, appearance and health status stored currently in League tracker
to `export_player_record.xls`, and overwrites the file if an older version exists.

* *TeamApachePoiWriter#write()* --- Writes the index number, team name, country, amount of sponsorship and number of players
stored currently in League tracker to `export_team_record.xls`, and overwrites the file if an older version exists.

* *MatchApachePoiWriter#write()* --- Writes the index number, date, home team, away team, ticket sales going to home team,
ticket sales going to away team, name(s) of goal scorer(s) and of own goal scorer(s) stored currently in League tracker
to `export_match_record.xls`, and overwrites the file if an older version exists.

* *FinanceApachePoiWriter#write()* --- Writes the index number, team name, amount of sponsorship received, amount of ticket
sales income, amount of total income, amount of Q1 income, amount of Q2 income, amount of Q3 income, amount of Q4 income
stored currently in League tracker to `export_match_record.xls`, and overwrites the file if an older version exists.

Given below is an example scenario of usage and how the export feature mechanism behaves internally at each step.
`exportPlayer` is used to illustrate the process as other commands all follow the same process.

Step 1: The user calls the `exportPlayer` command with a text input `exportPlayer` in the command box.

Step 2: The `MainWindow` calls `Logic#execute()`, `Logic` then calls `Parser#parseCommand()` to parse and identify the keyword
to decide what command to instantiate and execute.

Step 3: `Parser` identifies the keyword `exportPlayer` and instantiates a new `ExportPlayerCommand` object to be executed.

Step 4: the `ExportPlayerCommand` object first calls `Addressbook#getAllPlayers()` to obtain a list of all players currently
stored in League Tracker. It then calls `PlayerApachePoiWriter#write()` and pass the list inside.

Step 5: the `PlayerApachePoiWriter#write()` writes data to the output file path defined.

NOTE: The file path is defined in `outputFilepath`, and is hard-coded as `export_player_record.xls` for now. +
Any existing file with the same path will be overwritten.

Figure 3 below shows a sequence diagram that illustrates the process of `exportPlayer` command execution.

==== Implementation of write()
Given below is the algorithm behind the write() method used in export feature:

Step 1: Instantiate an object of  `PlayerApachePoiWriter`/ `TeamApachePoiWriter`/ `MatchApachePoiWriter` / `FinanceApachePoiWriter`

Step 2: Write the headers to the excel file

Step 3: Loop through the list passed in containing all players / teams / matches / finances in League Tracker to write
to the excel file.

.step 3 writing data code snippet (use `PlayerApachePoiWriter` as the example)
[source.java]
----
int num = allPlayers.size();

            for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
                ReadOnlyPlayer playerNow = allPlayers.get(i - 1);

                row = playerSheet.createRow(i);
                cell = row.createCell(0);
                cell.setCellValue(i);
                cell = row.createCell(1);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getName().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(2);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getTeamName().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(3);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getPositionPlayed().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(4);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getAge().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(5);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getSalary().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(6);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getGoalsScored().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(7);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getGoalsAssisted().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(8);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getNationality().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(9);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getJerseyNumber().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(10);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getAppearance().toString());
                cell = row.createCell(11);
                cell.setCellValue(playerNow.getHealthStatus().toString());
            }

            for (int j = 0; j <= 11; j++) {
                playerSheet.autoSizeColumn(j);
            }
----

Step 4: Close the `PlayerApachePoiWriter`/ `TeamApachePoiWriter`/ `MatchApachePoiWriter` / `FinanceApachePoiWriter`.

==== Design considerations
*Aspect* How data is passed into the writer object

* Alternative 1 (current choice): `List<ReadOnlyPlayer>` (same List<> container for the other three commands with their respective data types)
** Pros: Easy to implement as `getAllPlayer()` is already implemented in `Addressbook`
** Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each command is correct, which cannot be observed inside `exportPlayer` command

* Alternative 2: `Addressbook`
** Pros: Ensures data integrity as the whole set of data in League Tracker is passed in
** Cons: Additional amount of data are passed in which are unnecessary. Hard to write tests and requires more methods to process
 the data.

* Solution: The data is passed in to the writer object through its constructor as a List.
