== PROJECT: League Tracker

---

== Overview

CS2113T Software Engineering module in Semester 2 AY 2018/2019 required us to do a team project of enhancing a basic
command line interface application addressbook. My team and I decided to morph AdressBook Level 3 into a football league records
management application called League Tracker. This enhanced application helps league managers to record
 relevant information of players, teams, matches and finances in the league.
 Moreover, it processes the data to provide league managers with better organised information.
 League Tracker is a CLI (Command Line Interface) application written in OOP fashion with a very basic GUI.

My role in this project was to design and write the codes for the finance feature. The following sections
illustrate my contributions in more detail, as well as the relevant sections I have added to the
user and developer guides in relation to the finance feature.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the finance feature*
** What it does: It allows league managers to keep track of the financial income of each team in the league and even
visualise the trend of changes within certain time period.
** Justification: This feature improves the product because the financial aspect of a league is important to
league managers. The profitability of each team and the league indicates the survivability of them in the future.
** Highlights: This enhancement processes existing data from other classes and requires data analysis. It implements
visualisation of data trends as well.
