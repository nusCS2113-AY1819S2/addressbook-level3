== Setting up

=== Prerequisites

* JDK 9 or later
* IntelliJ IDE

=== Importing the project into IntelliJ

. Open IntelliJ (if you are not in the welcome screen, click `File` > `Close Project` to close the existing project dialog first)
. Set up the correct JDK version
.. Click `Configure` > `Project Defaults` > `Project Structure`
.. If JDK 9 is listed in the drop down, select it. If it is not, click `New...` and select the directory where you installed JDK 9
.. Click `OK`
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `OK`
. Click `Open as Project`
. Click `OK` to accept the default settings
. Run the `seedu.addressbook.Main` class (right-click the `Main` class and click `Run Main.main()`) and try executing a few commands
. Run all the tests (right-click the `test` folder, and click `Run 'All Tests'`) and ensure that they pass
. Open the `StorageFile` file and check for any code errors
.. Due to an ongoing https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/IDEA-189060[issue] with some of the newer versions of IntelliJ, code errors may be detected even if the project can be built and run successfully
.. To resolve this, place your cursor over any of the code section highlighted in red. Press kbd:[ALT + ENTER], and select `Add '--add-modules=java.xml.bind' to module compiler options`

== Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the *System* is the `AddressBook` and the *Actor* is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

=== Use case: Delete person

*MSS*

. User requests to list persons
. AddressBook shows a list of persons
. User requests to delete a specific person in the list
. AddressBook deletes the person.
+
Use case ends.

*Extensions*

* 2a. The list is empty.
+
Use case ends.

* 3a. The given index is invalid.
** 3a1. AddressBook shows an error message.
+
Use case resumes at step 2.

=== Use case: Login

*MSS*

. The user opens the addressbook
. Addressbook prompts’ user for username and password
. The user inputs the username/password and hits enter
. Addresbook authenticates the user and displays welcome address

Use case ends.

=== Use case: Referring a patient

*MSS*

. The user types refer NAME1 to NAME2 in the command line
. The information of the patient whose name is NAME1 is added to  the addressbook of the doctor whose name is NAME2
. The information of the patient whose name is NAME1 is removed from the user’s addressbook

Use case ends.

=== Use case: Managing appointments

*MSS*

. The user types a command appointments in the command line
. The system finds all scheduled appointments and prints them to the screen in chronological order
. If possible, can print a literal timetable on the screen
. The expired appointments should be excluded from the timetable if possible


Use case ends.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Sort feature
==== Current Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`. It stores a list of all persons in the address book as an `internalList`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UniquePersonList#SortByName()` -- Sort `internalList` by name column in alphabetical order
* `UniquePersonList#SortByAppointment()` -- Sort `internalList` by appointment column in alphabetical order
* `UniquePersonList#SortByStatus()` -- Sort `internalList` by status column in alphabetical order

These operations are exposed in `AddressBook` as `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)`. Corresponding operation will be called depending on attribute the user wants to sort the list by.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniquePersonList` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/…` to add some new people. These people will be added sequentially to the end of the list.

Step 3. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as list, will usually not call `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)` . Thus, the `internalList` remains unchanged.

Step 4. The user decides to view the list sorted by their name by executing the `sort name` command. This command will call `AddressBook#sorted(String attribute)` and pass the string “name” to the method. Since the value of parameter is “name”, `SortByName()` will be called. `internalList` will then be sorted by name column in alphabetical order. At last, `internalList` will be returned and displayed to the user.

. Should be able to hold up to 1000 persons.
. Should come with automated unit tests and open source code.
. Should favor DOS style commands over Unix-style commands.
